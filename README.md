# MCU1 Microcontroller Asrchitecurte and Assembly Language

A Set of PIC18F8722 Microcontroller projects I wrote when taking the Microcontroller Engineering 1 Course at Univeristy of Manchester under Profesor Frank Podd. 

The Code runs on a custom board with:
2x 7Seg Displays U1 & U2 Activated by Q1 & Q2 PNP Transistors 
8x Leds Activated by Q3 NPN Transistor  

Pins RF0-7 Represnet bit pattern for all 3 Displays. 
Hence all 3 Display Formats need to be Multiplexed.
