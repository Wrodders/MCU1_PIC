# PIC_UTILS
A Set of Examples to demonstate functionality of the PIC18F8722 Microcontroller

Input Output Board Contains:
2x 7Seg Displays U1 & U2 Activated by Q1 & Q2 PNP Transistors 
8x Leds Activated by Q3 NPN Transistor  

Pins RF0-7 Represnet bit pattern for all 3 Displays. 
Hence all 3 Display Formats need to be Multiplexed.
